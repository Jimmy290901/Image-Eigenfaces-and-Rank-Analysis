Rank and eigenfaces
Last slide
PCA explantion slides - required or not
Title - Eigenfaces of Related Image
Relation with ITS - How to relate with ITS? Where will this be used?


Relation with ITS - It is the basis and at the core of image classification, can be used for various applications like vehicle plate recognition, identifying model of the vehicle, etc.


Other Notes:
(After front slide) Outline - Exploit Redundancy to compress Images
			PCA - Image Compression and Image Redundancy
				What is PCA (small intro)
				Illustration of PCA
			Problem statement
			Preliminary Observations

2 - Rectangle check rank (Remove Eigenfaces), more number of images to demonstrate redundancy and imp. of rank
4 - what is PCA slide
	How is PCA useful?
		Minimizes information loss by exploiting redundancy
		Remove 2nd pt
		(Improve) Capturing comp. with maximum variability
3 - (Title - SVD Decmp of Images) Image - Various columns, symmetry, redundancy, dimension, how top 20 singular values is compressing 2000 columns to 20 columns and how it is i (Spend more time on this slide)
8th - Label axis on the graph	


Problem statement - Show various transformations of image (Talk about laying foundation for image classfication)
		Relationship between eigen of user inputted and img in database (for future works)


Experiment Apparatus (Remove procedure (it is extra) )
13th - Preliminary (low rank, less symmetry, etc. include all of that)
12th - Work is still ongoing, but some glimpses from our observations

Summary of paper at the end (Only if someone asks questions about how what tools, etc you used)
10th - Compress and intro (Procedure should come as extra slides at the end)


Remove PCA (5,6,7,9 slide)

Notes: 
SVD can help in data compression and finding the principal components
Rank of a matrix can tell us the number of significant eigenfaces required to express the original image precisely.



Assymetrical Low Rank Image:
	I


Assymetrical High Rank Image:
	Rotation: Number of significant eigenfaces increased little
	HR: No Change
	VR: ""
	Scaling UP: Rank increased largely, number of significant eigenfaces remained same
	Scaling DOWN: Rank increased number of significant eigenfaces remained same
	Adding Noise: 
		Low Noise: No Change
		High Noise: Rank jumped to maximum, number of significant eigenfaces increased.

Symmetrical Low rank Image:
	Number of significant eigenfaces=2, rank = 18
	Rotation: Number of significant eigenfaces increased with rotation
	HR: No Change
	VR: ""
	Scaling UP: Rank increased by slight amount, number of significant eigenfaces remained same
	Scaling DOWN: Rack decreased slightly, number of significant eigenfaces remained same
	Adding Noise:
		Low Noise: Rank increased slightly, no change in number of eigenfaces
		High Noise: Rank jumped to maximum, number of significant eigenfaces remained same

Symmetrical High Rank Image:
	Number of significant eigenfaces = 23, rank = 131
	Rotation: Number of significant eigenfaces increased with rotation
	HR: No Change
	VR: ""
	Scaling UP: ""
	Scaling DOWN: ""
	Adding Noise:
		Low Noise: No Change
		High Noise: Rank jumped to maximum, number of significant eigenfaces remained same
